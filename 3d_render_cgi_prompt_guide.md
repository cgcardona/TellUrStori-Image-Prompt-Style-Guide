## Advanced Tips

### 1. **Material Specificity**

- "chrome material" for metallic surfaces
- "glass material" for transparent objects
- "fabric material" for cloth textures
- "wood material" for natural surfaces

### 2. **Lighting Quality**

- "studio lighting" for commercial quality
- "natural lighting" for realistic environments
- "dramatic lighting" for artistic impact
- "even lighting" for technical diagrams

### 3. **Rendering Quality**

- "photorealistic" for true-to-life appearance
- "high-quality render" for professional results
- "detailed render" for intricate models
- "clean render" for minimal artifacts

### 4. **Purpose Specificity**

- "product visualization" for commercial use
- "architectural visualization" for building renders
- "character visualization" for 3D characters
- "technical visualization" for diagrams

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **2D terms**: Avoid painting or drawing terminology
2. **Poor materials**: Use specific 3D material descriptions
3. **Inconsistent lighting**: Maintain 3D-appropriate lighting
4. **Missing perspective**: Include 3D perspective information
5. **Generic quality**: Specify rendering quality and technique

Remember: 3D renders and CGI emphasize three-dimensional depth, realistic materials, and professional rendering quality. Focus on geometric precision, material properties, and lighting systems while maintaining the distinctive 3D aesthetic.
