## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Digital appearance**: Avoid terms that suggest digital art
2. **Flat colors**: Use terms that suggest traditional paint textures
3. **Geometric precision**: Embrace organic, hand-painted qualities
4. **Inconsistent technique**: Maintain traditional painting style throughout
5. **Missing texture**: Include surface and texture descriptions

Remember: Watercolor and traditional painting emphasize the organic, hand-crafted nature of art. Focus on paint textures, brushwork, and traditional techniques while avoiding digital or mechanical qualities.
