## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too realistic**: Avoid realistic proportions and physics
2. **Logical composition**: Embrace impossible and illogical elements
3. **Mundane elements**: Include surreal and dreamlike features
4. **Inconsistent style**: Maintain surrealist aesthetic throughout
5. **Missing symbolism**: Include symbolic and metaphorical elements

Remember: Surrealism and dreamlike art thrive on the impossible, the unconscious, and the symbolic. Focus on creating scenes that defy logic and reality while maintaining emotional and psychological depth.
