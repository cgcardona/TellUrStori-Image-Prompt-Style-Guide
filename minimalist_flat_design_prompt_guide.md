## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too complex**: Avoid detailed or cluttered compositions
2. **Poor spacing**: Use generous white space and clean layouts
3. **Too many colors**: Limit color palette to essential colors
4. **Inconsistent style**: Maintain minimalist aesthetic throughout
5. **Missing focus**: Ensure clear visual hierarchy and focal points

Remember: Minimalist and flat design emphasize simplicity, clarity, and essential elements. Focus on clean compositions, limited color palettes, and clear visual communication while avoiding unnecessary complexity.
