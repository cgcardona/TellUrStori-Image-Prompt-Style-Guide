## Advanced Tips

### 1. **Material Specificity**

- "glass facade" for modern buildings
- "concrete structure" for industrial style
- "stone cladding" for classical buildings
- "wood paneling" for warm interiors

### 2. **Lighting Quality**

- "natural daylight" for realistic exteriors
- "interior lighting" for room renders
- "golden hour" for dramatic exteriors
- "even lighting" for technical presentations

### 3. **Scale and Context**

- "human scale" for relatable proportions
- "urban context" for city environments
- "landscape integration" for natural settings
- "site planning" for master plans

### 4. **Presentation Purpose**

- "marketing visualization" for real estate
- "technical presentation" for construction
- "design development" for architects
- "planning approval" for government

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Unrealistic proportions**: Maintain accurate architectural scale
2. **Poor lighting**: Use appropriate lighting for the building type
3. **Inconsistent materials**: Ensure material compatibility
4. **Missing context**: Include environmental and site context
5. **Low quality**: Maintain professional presentation standards

Remember: Architectural visualization emphasizes accuracy, professionalism, and clear communication of design intent. Focus on precise proportions, appropriate materials, and professional presentation while maintaining architectural authenticity.
