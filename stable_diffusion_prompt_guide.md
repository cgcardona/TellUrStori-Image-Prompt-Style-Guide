# Stable Diffusion Prompt Guide: Creating Photorealistic & Beautiful Images

## Core Principles

### 1. **Specificity is Key**

- Use precise, descriptive language
- Include specific details about lighting, composition, and style
- Mention exact camera settings and techniques

### 2. **Technical Photography Terms**

- **Camera settings**: "shot on Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4 lens, shallow depth of field"
- **Lighting**: "golden hour lighting, soft natural light, dramatic side lighting"
- **Composition**: "rule of thirds, leading lines, symmetrical composition"
- **Quality**: "8K resolution, highly detailed, professional photography"

### 3. **Style Modifiers**

- **Photorealistic**: "photorealistic, hyperrealistic, ultra-detailed"
- **Professional**: "professional photography, award-winning, National Geographic style"
- **Cinematic**: "cinematic lighting, movie poster style, dramatic atmosphere"

## Essential Prompt Structure

### Base Template

```text
[subject], [action/pose], [lighting], [camera settings], [style], [quality], [composition], [mood/atmosphere]
```

### Example

```text
A majestic lion, standing proudly on a rocky outcrop, golden hour lighting, shot on Canon EOS R5 with 200mm f/2.8 lens, shallow depth of field, photorealistic, 8K resolution, rule of thirds composition, dramatic atmosphere, National Geographic style
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. **Lighting Descriptions**

## Negative Prompts (What to Avoid)

### Essential Negative Prompts

```

### Advanced Negative Prompts

```text
low resolution, poor lighting, amateur photography, cell phone photo, grainy, noisy, out of focus, motion blur, chromatic aberration, lens flare, vignette
```

## Specialized Categories

### 1. **Portraits**

```text
professional headshot, studio lighting, shallow depth of field, sharp focus on eyes, natural skin texture, professional makeup, high-end fashion photography
```

### 2. **Landscapes**

```text
aerial photography, drone shot, golden hour, dramatic clouds, leading lines, rule of thirds, panoramic view, HDR processing
```

### 3. **Architecture**

```text
architectural photography, clean lines, geometric composition, dramatic shadows, golden hour lighting, wide-angle lens, professional real estate photography
```

### 4. **Nature/Wildlife**

```text
wildlife photography, natural habitat, environmental portrait, telephoto lens, shallow depth of field, National Geographic style, documentary photography
```

## Prompt Engineering Tips

### 1. **Weighting System**

Use parentheses and numbers to emphasize elements:

- `(photorealistic:1.2)` - 20% more emphasis
- `(golden hour lighting:1.5)` - 50% more emphasis
- `(blurry:-1.2)` - 20% less emphasis in negative prompts

### 2. **Sequential Prompting**

Break complex scenes into parts:

```text
"professional studio setup, three-point lighting, (subject), (pose), (expression), (clothing), (background), photorealistic, 8K resolution"
```

### 3. **Reference Images**

- Mention specific styles: "in the style of [photographer]"
- Reference specific techniques: "shot like a [publication] cover"
- Use descriptive comparisons: "as detailed as a [reference]"
