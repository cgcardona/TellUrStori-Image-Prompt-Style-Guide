- "32-bit resolution" for modern pixel art
- "pixel perfect" for clean pixel edges

### 2. **Color Theory**

- "limited palette" for authentic retro look
- "dithering" for color blending technique
- "retro colors" for classic game aesthetics
- "modern palette" for contemporary pixel art

### 3. **Game Era References**

- "8-bit era" for classic arcade games
- "16-bit era" for SNES/Genesis games
- "32-bit era" for PlayStation/Saturn games

### 4. **Sprite Design**

- "character sprite" for game characters
- "environment sprite" for game backgrounds
- "item sprite" for game objects
- "animation sprite" for moving characters

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Smooth art**: Avoid terms that suggest smooth, non-pixelated art
2. **High resolution**: Use appropriate pixel resolutions for the style
3. **Realistic proportions**: Embrace pixel art's stylized proportions
4. **Inconsistent style**: Maintain pixel art aesthetic throughout
5. **Missing resolution**: Specify pixel resolution for authenticity

Remember: Pixel art and retro game styles emphasize deliberate pixel placement, limited color palettes, and nostalgic gaming aesthetics. Focus on clean pixels, appropriate resolutions, and retro color schemes while maintaining the distinctive pixel art aesthetic.
