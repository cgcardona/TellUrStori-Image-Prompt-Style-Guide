# Abstract Art Style Prompt Guide

## Core Principles

### 1. **Abstract Art Aesthetics**
- Non-representational forms and shapes
- Focus on color, line, and composition
- Emotional and expressive content
- Freedom from realistic representation
- Artistic interpretation and creativity

### 2. **Abstract Art Movements**
- **Expressionism**: Emotional, gestural, intense
- **Cubism**: Geometric, fragmented, analytical
- **Minimalism**: Simple, clean, essential elements
- **Color Field**: Large areas of color, atmospheric

### 3. **Abstract Techniques**
- **Gestural**: Free-flowing, expressive brushwork
- **Geometric**: Precise shapes, mathematical composition
- **Organic**: Natural, flowing, biomorphic forms
- **Textural**: Surface quality, material exploration

## Essential Prompt Structure

### Base Template:
```

### 3. **Color Strategies**
- **Bold**: "bold colors, vibrant palette, intense colors, dramatic color"
- **Subtle**: "subtle colors, muted palette, soft colors, gentle tones"
- **Contrasting**: "contrasting colors, complementary colors, color opposition"
- **Harmonious**: "harmonious colors, color harmony, unified palette, cohesive colors"

### 4. **Technique Variations**
- **Gestural**: "gestural painting, expressive brushwork, free-flowing, emotional"
- **Geometric**: "geometric painting, precise shapes, mathematical, structured"
- **Organic**: "organic forms, natural shapes, flowing, biomorphic"
- **Textural**: "textured painting, surface quality, material exploration, tactile"

- "meditative mood" for contemplative abstract
- "energetic mood" for dynamic abstract
- "calm atmosphere" for peaceful abstract

### 2. **Composition Quality**
- "dynamic composition" for movement and energy
- "balanced composition" for harmony and stability
- "minimal composition" for essential elements
- "complex composition" for intricate abstract

### 3. **Color Theory**
- "color harmony" for unified palette
- "color contrast" for dramatic effect
- "color flow" for smooth transitions
- "color intensity" for bold impact

### 4. **Technique Specificity**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Representational elements**: Avoid recognizable objects or figures
2. **Literal interpretation**: Focus on abstract, non-representational forms
3. **Poor composition**: Maintain strong abstract composition principles
4. **Inconsistent style**: Keep abstract aesthetic throughout
5. **Missing emotion**: Include emotional or expressive elements

Remember: Abstract art emphasizes non-representational forms, emotional expression, and artistic creativity. Focus on color, composition, and technique while avoiding literal or realistic representation.
